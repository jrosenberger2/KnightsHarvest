KnightsHarvest: Improved Data Collection and Storage for Knight’s Pantry

Jared Rosenberger / jrosenberger2@bellarmine.edu / Faculty Mentor: Nathan Johnson

KnightsHarvest is a web app that automates data collection, storage, and visualization for the Bellarmine University Knight’s Pantry. Knight’s Pantry is a food pantry for students and faculty on Bellarmine’s campus organized by the Center for Community Engagement (CCE) and sponsored by Dare to Care. The CCE is responsible for collecting and reporting data, including demographic and food data as well as other salient information. Data collection is currently done via pen and paper, and reporting requires the CCE to collate all data by hand. Typically, this is done by looking at all submitted forms once a month near the reporting window. KnightsHarvest will improve the efficiency of this process and reduce the number of man-hours required for collating and reporting pantry data. KnightsHarvest utilizes Microsoft services such as Forms and Power Automate, as well as the Microsoft Graph API to display collected data as well as minimal analysis needed for reporting.

KnightsHarvest is built with the Streamlit package, and is organized into a boot file (KnightsHarvest.py) and 3 pages (Dashboard, Pantry, and Closet).
